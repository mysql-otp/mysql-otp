MySQL/OTP
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mysql-otp/mysql-otp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mysql-otp/mysql-otp)

MySQL/OTP is a driver for connecting Erlang/OTP applications to MySQL
databases (version 4.1 and upward). It is a native implementation of the MySQL
protocol in Erlang.

Some of the features:

* Mnesia style transactions:
  * Nested transactions are implemented using savepoints.
  * Transactions are automatically retried when deadlocks are detected.
* Uses the binary protocol for prepared statements.
* Each connection is a gen_server, which makes it compatible with Poolboy (for
  connection pooling) and ordinary OTP supervisors.
* No records in the public API.
* Slow queries are interrupted without killing the connection (MySQL version
  â‰¥ 5.0.0).

* [MySQL/OTP + Poolboy](https://github.com/mysql-otp/mysql-otp-poolboy):
  A simple application that combines MySQL/OTP with Poolboy for connection
  pooling.

Synopsis
--------

```Erlang
%% Connect
{ok, Pid} = mysql:start_link([{host, "localhost"}, {user, "foo"},
                              {password, "hello"}, {database, "test"}]),

%% Select
{ok, ColumnNames, Rows} =
    mysql:query(Pid, <<"SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id = ?">>, [1]),

%% Manipulate data
ok = mysql:query(Pid, "INSERT INTO mytable (id, bar) VALUES (?, ?)", [1, 42]),

%% Separate calls to fetch more info about the last query
LastInsertId = mysql:insert_id(Pid),
AffectedRows = mysql:affected_rows(Pid),
WarningCount = mysql:warning_count(Pid),

%% Mnesia style transaction (nestable)
Result = mysql:transaction(Pid, fun () ->
    ok = mysql:query(Pid, "INSERT INTO mytable (foo) VALUES (1)"),
    throw(foo),
    ok = mysql:query(Pid, "INSERT INTO mytable (foo) VALUES (1)")
end),
case Result of
    {atomic, ResultOfFun} ->
        io:format("Inserted 2 rows.~n");
    {aborted, Reason} ->
        io:format("Inserted 0 rows.~n")
end

%% Multiple queries and multiple result sets
{ok, [{[<<"foo">>], [[42]]}, {[<<"bar">>], [[<<"baz">>]]}]} =
    mysql:query(Pid, "SELECT 42 AS foo; SELECT 'baz' AS bar;"),

%% Graceful timeout handling: SLEEP() returns 1 when interrupted
{ok, [<<"SLEEP(5)">>], [[1]]} =
    mysql:query(Pid, <<"SELECT SLEEP(5)">>, 1000),
```

Usage as a dependency
---------------------

Using *erlang.mk*:

    DEPS = mysql
    dep_mysql = git https://github.com/mysql-otp/mysql-otp 1.1.1

Using *rebar*:

    {deps, [
        {mysql, ".*", {git, "https://github.com/mysql-otp/mysql-otp",
                       {tag, "1.1.1"}}}
    ]}.

Contributing
------------

Run the eunit tests with `make tests`. For the suite `mysql_tests` you
need MySQL running on localhost and give privileges to the `otptest` user:

```SQL
grant all privileges on otptest.* to otptest@localhost identified by 'otptest';
```

If you run `make tests COVER=1` a coverage report will be generated. Open
`cover/index.html` to see that any lines you have added or modified are covered
by a test.

Linebreak code to 80 characters per line and follow a coding style similar to
that of existing code.

Keep commit messages short and descriptive. Each commit message should describe
the purpose of the commit, the feature added or bug fixed, so that the commit
log can be used as a comprehensive change log. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is
generated from the commit messages.
